# GitHub Pages Static Website

## Task Overview
This project was created as part of *Task 6* of a DevOps internship to learn how to deploy a static website using *GitHub Pages*.

## What I Did
- Created a simple index.html file with basic HTML content.
- Pushed the code to a new public GitHub repository.
- Enabled GitHub Pages from the repository settings.
- Selected the main branch and root folder as the source.
- Accessed the live website from the URL provided by GitHub Pages.

## Optional Customization
I also added a style.css file to style the page and make it look more presentable.
